# Theory/Concepts
to get start connect breadboard rail positive and negative with 5v and GND on arduno r3 respectively
connect LED which is called component (always remember short leg goes to GND) another leg connects to digital pin

## Key concepts explained:
- LEDs are polarized components, meaning current must flow in the one correct direction.
Short leg = Cathode = GND (negative)
Long leg = Anode = +5V or Digital Output
since Anode → Cathode
so that the flow would be Digital Pin → LED → GND
If the LED is reversed, it will not light up.
- always use resistor with LED to limits current from the Arduino pin
- Using a Digital Pin to Control an LED
A digital pin on the Arduino can output:
HIGH (5V) → LED turns ON
LOW (0V) → LED turns OFF
By connecting the LED’s long leg to a digital pin, the Arduino can turn the LED on and off using code.
Example:
digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // LED ON
digitalWrite(8, LOW);  // LED OFF

## How it works
- Electric Current Flows from HIGH to LOW
- Resistor Controls Current to Protect Components
- Digital Pins Use Voltage Levels to Represent ON/OFF
- The Circuit Needs a Complete Path: source -> components-> GND

## Important terminology
- Polarity: The direction in which current must flow.
Some components (like LEDs) only work in one direction.
- Anode & Cathode (LED)
Anode (long leg) = + (connects to digital pin or +5V)
Cathode (short leg) = – (connects to GND)
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): analog like output by switching a pin ON and OFF very fast

Code Snippet
```cpp
int ledPin = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
